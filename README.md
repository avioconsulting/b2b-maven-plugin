# B2B Maven Plugin

This plugin helps adopt a development lifecycle when working with B2B artifacts.

The general idea is to use the B2B console on your laptop as an "IDE". Everything goes in there.

This plugin assists with extracting out document types, trading partners, and agreements from your local install into source control and then "deploying" those to target environments.

This goes hand in hand with avio-b2b-12.2.1-2.0.pom which adds the standard environment settings.
